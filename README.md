# HoyaHacks-2023
This is me and my groups HoyaHacks 2023 project


Features to be implemented:

Able to change speed of metronome, to standard beats, or change to custom time

A image that goes along with the beats maybe it shakes or gets bigger and smaller. we can make a ginga block in some in document css maybe?

change the sound to either a selection of sounds or any sound, maybe set a time limit to 1 second or whatever

A frontend for the website made with bootstrap or another css framework(I know bootstrap 5)

fun pictures to make the user feel happy



more ideas?




Extra features (if we have time):

music to choose from 

More ideas?



the pitch:

By offering a more fun metronome we can make musicians practice more fun and easier for them to do. 

It is also highly customizable and this is good so they can choose what they want for their instrument.
