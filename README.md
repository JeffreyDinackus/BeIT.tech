# HoyaHacks-2023
This is me and my groups HoyaHacks 2023 project

This project won HoyaHacks 2023 for "best Verbwire"


The concept for this project is to give a place for Information Technology students a central place to find tech related volunteering opportunities. It can be very good for ones IT career to find a church or a small business and then work on their computers and printers once a week to get experience and have war stories to tell at future job interviews. 

On completion of a job, a NFT is minted.
